<h1>NIKE Zoom Pegasus Turbo</h1>

    <p>The Nike Zoom Pegasus Turbo is a lightweight version of the brand’s popular Pegasus running shoe. Its headline feature is the ZoomX foam, which first featured in Nike’s revolutionary VaporFly 4% shoe and was used later in the VaporFly Elite. The tech originally emerged as part of Nike’s Breaking2 initiative, which targeted – and came within 25 seconds of – a sub two-hour marathon. Both of those models were really hard to come by for consumers, but now the tech is trickling down to more mainstream running shoes, designed to be worn every day.</p>

    <h1>ASICS GEL-KAYANO 25</h1>

    <p> The ASICS Kayano 25 running shoe is custom-built for endurance, so whether you’re heading into competition or a long training run, this training shoe will keep you feeling strong all the way to collapsing in a heap at the finish line. Protection and stability are the name of the game here. The company’s FlyteFoam Lyte tech promises shock absorption, while the medial support system and metaclutch cradle hold the heel in place. There’s a redesigned, two-layer Jacquard mesh upper, and a more spacious toe box to protect your feet on those gruelling endurance runs.</p>

    <h1>ADIDAS ULTRABOOST 19</h1>

    <img src=./adidas.jpg>

    <p>The most substantial revamp of the wildly popular UltraBOOST since its launch back in 2015, the UltraBOOST 19 features several updates designed to make it feel more comfortable and responsive on the foot. That starts with Adidas adding 20% more Boost into the midsole, which makes the shoe firmer and bouncier when running, with the torsion system built into the sole also adding some snap to the heel-to-toe transition of the shoe.</p>
